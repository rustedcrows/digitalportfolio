    <h2>IKE Tourism</h2>
        <p> The third major project we did in class was a tourism website designed to attract tourists to countries. The project was a group project, with each team member working on a different country. The website is a little more developed with its use of CSS and HTML. There are still flaws, though. It was the second time that we, as a class, made a website from scratch. <br>

        <br> I felt a little more confident in my ability to make a website after the last one was made, but I was not still fully confident. I still struggled with the CSS, but HTML was definitely really easy for this project. We had written everything out beforehand, so I knew exactly what to put with a few small edits. <br>
            
        <br> My main struggle with this assignment was definitely CSS. With communication and persistence, though, it was far easier to do than it was before. I have learned that no matter how hard you try, sometimes things just break when you least expect it to. To combat this, you need to adapt and fix the issues, should you have time and the ability to do so.
