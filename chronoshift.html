        <h2> Chronoshift Project</h2>

        <p>The second major project we did was the Chronoshift Expeditions website based off of the short story “A Sound of Thunder” by Ray Bradbury. The website was our first project created from scratch, without the assistance of a pre-existing website template to fill out. The programs we used to create the page were Figma for prototyping, and Visual Studio Code to actually create it. <br>

        <br>The programming languages used in this project were HTML and CSS. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was used to create the text and the web pages themselves. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, was used to make the pages look the way they do.  At the time of creation, I did not have very much experience in CSS. I have more now, but I am still learning it. <br>
            
        <br>The assignment was difficult, similarly to the About Me pages on Adobe Spark. It was difficult for another reason. It was difficult, because I had very barebones knowledge of the languages we used in the project. I struggled a lot with it, but thankfully I was able to persevere with the CART Habit of Mind and assistance from my teacher and classmates. Communication was also important in doing well for this project.
