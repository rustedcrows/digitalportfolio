        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is Emily Odam, and I will graduate from Clovis High in 2022. This is my first and only year at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART). I joined CART in order to take classes that may teach me skills in order to gain a little bit of insight into the careers I may want to pursue. I am in the Web Application Development lab, and since I did not attend last year, this is the only lab I have taken. My current plan is to attend Clovis Community College for my general education.<br>

        <br>I have some hobbies outside of school. I enjoy playing video games, and spending time with my friends. I also did stagecraft tech theater for my freshman, sophomore, and junior years of high school. I was also part of the crew for one show my freshman and sophomore year. In my freshman year, I did spotlights for my school production of Sugar. In my sophomore year, I was a fly line technician for my school production of Curtains.<br>

        <br>I encourage you to check out the rest of my portfolio, where you can see projects I have worked on! I also encourage you to reach out to me! Thank you for reading! Oh, and also, thank you for visting my portfolio site!!</p>
