        <h2> First Project</h2>

        <p> The first website I had ever created was an “About Me” website on Adobe Spark. The purpose of this assignment was to tell my classmates about me, and to learn more about them. As stated before, we used the Adobe Spark program in order to create these. Pages on the website contained very basic information about me and my hopes for the future. <br>

        <br> Going in blind with no prior experience or knowledge on how to make something like this was difficult. I had no idea how to make a website, much less even write about myself. The website also required the use of images. On the page, I included pictures of me with my friends. I also used a couple of royalty free images. <br>
            
        <br> I think my main struggle came with finding information about me that was interesting and worth sharing. I really do not like talking about myself, since I do not find myself interesting. I did manage to pull through to persist, and have information that was worth sharing, and so I was able to make the website and have it end up looking nice in the end.  </p>
