            <h2> Interactive Story Project </h2>

            <p> The final project we did was an interactive story project. The project was done over the course of two months, and incorporated the use of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Most of the code, though, is in JavaScript. The HTML is minimal, and there is some CSS to make the website look nice. <br>

            <br> The main struggles in this project came from coming up with a good enough story that was interesting enough to get the attention of players and keeping them engaged. The JavaScript was also a little difficult to figure out because if one thing was wrong, the entire thing would break. The project was also a group project, so that also posed issues if there were conflicting interests. Luckily, in my group, there were not conflicting interests and it was a relatively easy project in that sense. <br>
                
            <br> Communication and collaboration were key in this project, since it was a team project. Both of these proved to make the project much easier, over trying to just do it as one person on their own trying to do it. Using these habits, the project ended well and ended up in a final product I am happy with.
